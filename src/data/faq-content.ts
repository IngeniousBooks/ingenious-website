    question: "Why haven’t I heard about you before?",
    response: [
      "That’s because our new-look Ingenious website launched in September 2024!",
      "But our team has decades of combined experience as in-house staff and freelancers with well-known publishers including Faber & Faber, Hachette and Penguin/Random House, as well as supporting many indie presses like you.",
      "Book a meeting today and get to know us.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "I do all the work myself — do I need your services?",
    response: [
      "We’ve worked with many indie publishers like you who commission, edit, design and market their books themselves, as well as manage the schedule and strategise for the future.",
      "It’s a heroic effort and we celebrate you! But wouldn’t your talents and skills be more effective elsewhere?",
      "With Ingenious you can maximise your resources to engage with the latest industry news, discover new authors, nurture current authors, commission your next bestseller, meet with agents, read the slush pile, produce innovative marketing strategies, connect with readers, arrange events, and plan for a dynamic future, to name just a few.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "I’m not sure I have the budget for outside help",
    response: [
      "We know that indie publishers grapple with tight finances and high risks in the modern publishing industry, but we believe our cost-effective rates, exceptional quality of work and personal service is worth its weight in gold in the long run.",
      "We also offer flexible payment plans, so you can spread the cost.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question:
      "I’ve been disappointed by freelancers or book services in the past — can I trust you?",
    response: [
      "We hear you.",
      "It’s a difficult decision to hand over your precious manuscript or design, especially with tight budgets and deadlines, let alone the negative impact on the author and book sales. During our time as staff in the traditional publishing industry, we also experienced the variable quality and reliability of freelance contractors.",
      "It’s the reason why we created Ingenious.",
      "We dedicate ourselves to building long-term, productive relationships with indie publishers as a result of high-quality work and personal connection. And through that process, we gain a full understanding of your unique challenges and opportunities to become an extension of your publishing team.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question:
      "Do you subcontract to gig economy freelancers on Fiverr and Upwork?",
    response: [
      "Absolutely not.",
      "Unlike many book services companies, we never subcontract work to cheaper freelancers of unknown skills and experience. Our expert team are all based in the UK and have collaborated together for many years.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "What if I’m dissatisfied with the quality of your services?",
    response: [
      "We’re supremely confident that our premium services will blow you away, but if you’re not completely satisfied, we’ll refund your project fee in full.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Can I see more examples of your work?",
    response: [
      "Of course! We’ve collaborated on hundreds of books of every genre and category, though we can only display a small selection on our website.",
      "If you’re unsure whether our design services are right for you and your book, we’d be happy to show off more of our exquisite cover and page designs.",
